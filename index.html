               Device-Free Wi-Fi Sensing (DFWS) is becoming a popular research due to the ubiquitous availability of Wi-Fi signals and comparatively accurate sensing with less infrastructure.
               The primary advantage of DFWS is exploiting the Wi-Fi signals around us to detect a person, fall, gesture location detection, and various other applications passively. 
               In comparison with state-of-the-art techniques using sensors, cameras, or wearables to monitor an environment or person, DFWS uses Wi-Fi signal patterns to sense the state.
               The main advantage of being device-free is that it does not require any specifc devices like sensors or cameras. 
               DFWS can be an ideal solution for many applications like the Internet of Things (IoT), Human Activity Recognition (HAR), monitoring elderly people, and many more since it is less obtrusive and offers pervasive sensing.
               The earliest work on "Sensorless Sensing" is a human sensing application using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based detection.
               These preliminary works on localization and tracking the presence of humans accelerated the deployment of various applications based on DFWS.
               Unlike the use of RSSI, Channel State Information (CSI) in 802:11n gave more fine-grained dive into the Physical (PHY) layer and leverage useful information at every frame level.

            <h2>Wi-ESP is Why-ESP?</h2>
            ESP32 is a low cost IoT device can also be used to acquire CSI. 
            This provides low cost deployment of the solution to the problem.

            <h2>Steps to acquire CSI by ESP32</h2>
            <p>This toolkit is used with WROOM 32 and ESP32 WROVER</p>
            <ul>
                Steps to acquire CSI are as follows:
                <li>Step-1: Setup the wireless network to acquire CSI.</li>
                <li>Step-2: Make Client/Server architecture to generate traffic.</li>
                <li>Step-3: Acquire CSI to configure ESP32 on the same channle on which Wireless Network is established.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>ESP32 console based Configuration Settings</h2>
            <p>
                There are few configurations which are very necessary to acquire CSI.
                We have included all these settings in the manuscript and discuused very much in detail.
                These setting includes CPU clock setting, we need to set at maximum so that we can acquire CSI at maximum rate.
                UART baud rate is very necessary to acquire CSI from ESP32 board.
                This settings depends on the board type of ESP32 we are using to acquire CSI.
                Third settings is the SSID information, which need to set before acquring the CSI.
                The last but the most important setting is the Enabling to get CSI.
                All these settings can be performed thorigh source code but the more easy way is by using console.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                There are different options are available to set the clock frequency of the processor.
                The best is to select maximum which is 240MHz.
                In some cases this is observed that low clock rate can also work but this is better to select the clock rate maximum.
            </p>

            </figure>        
            <p>
                The baud rate settings is necessary in case you are using UART port to commuincate to the ESP32.
                The Baud rate depends upon the board type you are using to acquire CSI.
                There are many kinds of board are available in the market. Select that board which provides you maximum baud rate which is 2M.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                The CSI gathering can be performed without using this. But still we have done this to avoid any confusion. 
                The important thing to acquire CSI is the channel number which are you uisng for transmission
                This is better to filter the channel number and MAC address to minimze the traffic otherwise the traffic need to be filter at later stage.
            </p>

            </figure>           
             <p>
                 The most important setting of the ESP32 is the enabling the CSI by using the console.
                 This must be enable before configuring ESP32.
